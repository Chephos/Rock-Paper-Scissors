# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A beginner python project used to test my knowledge of conditional statements, loops and inputs...
It's played between one user and the computer.
The user inputs either rock,paper or scissors and the computer randomly choses between rock paper and scissors in response to the user's input.
have fun
